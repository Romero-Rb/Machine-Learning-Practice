# Romero Robb's Machine Learning Practice Portfolio 

This repository is a collection of code where i practice understanding and creating machine learning algorithms
While i'm building my portfolio i'll add projects to to this repository and highlight ones that showcase mutliple skills. For now take a look around and feel free to provide any feedback.
